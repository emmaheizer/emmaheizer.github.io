		<h2> Some Info </h2>
		<p> A road less traveled led me to this place in my career. A creative problem solver at heart with an academic background in biology and business management (Wake Forest '14) and professional training in software sales (Oracle), I'm looking forward to furthering my career in product design. I want to solve the world's problems through a marriage of technology and creativity. I was once told to "get on with the butter" by an Icelandic friend. Translation: do what you're supposed to be doing, no point wasting time. After experiencing a variety of work environments and exploring my interests, I've found what I'm supposed to be doing and am ready to get on with it.</p>
		<p> I'm searching for a group of innovative, talented people who aren't affraid of wild ideas and are driven to solve real life problems with technology. In short, I'm your Alan Turing, but with better people skills. </p>
