		<h2> Some Info </h2>
		<p> I've taken a road less traveled to get here, but I'm looking forward to furthering my career in product design. I want to solve the world's problems through a marriage of technology and creativity.  I was once told to "get on with the butter" by an Icelandic friend. Translation: no point wasting time, do what you're supposed to be doing. </p>
		<p> I'm looking to join a group of innovative, talented people who aren't affraid of wild ideas and enjoy solving real life problems with technology.  I'm your Alan Turing, but with better people skills. </p>
